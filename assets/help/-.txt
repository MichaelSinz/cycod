CHATX STDIN (`-`)

  The `-` symbol is used to represent the standard input (stdin) for file
  content. When you use `-` as a file name, CHATX will read from the standard
  input instead of a file. This is useful when you want to pipe content
  directly into CHATX from another command or script.

USAGE: chatx - [FILE1 [FILE2]] [...]
