# Using MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers with ChatX

ChatX supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for integrating with external tools and services. This document explains how to configure and use MCP servers with ChatX.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables secure integration between LLMs and various data sources and tools.

Some examples of what you can do with MCP:
- Connect to databases and query data
- Call APIs and web services
- Execute custom code or tools
- Access external knowledge bases

## Configuring MCP Servers

You can configure MCP servers using the `chatx mcp` commands:

```bash
# List all configured MCP servers
chatx mcp list

# Add a new stdio-based MCP server
chatx mcp add postgres-db --command /path/to/postgres-mcp-server --arg --connection-string --arg "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"

# Add a new SSE-based MCP server
chatx mcp add rest-api --url https://example.com/mcp-sse-endpoint

# Add environment variables to an MCP server
chatx mcp add weather-api --command /path/to/weather-tool --env API_KEY=abc123 --env CACHE_DIR=/tmp

# Get details of a specific MCP server
chatx mcp get postgres-db

# Remove an MCP server
chatx mcp remove postgres-db
```

## How ChatX Uses MCP Servers

When you start a chat session, ChatX automatically:

1. Finds all configured MCP servers
2. Connects to each server
3. Retrieves the list of available tools
4. Makes these tools available to the LLM during the chat

The LLM can then use these tools to perform actions like querying databases, calling APIs, or executing custom code.

## Example Usage

After configuring an MCP server, you can use it in a chat session:

```bash
# Start a chat session
chatx

# Ask a question that might use an MCP tool
User: What is the current weather in New York?

# If a weather MCP tool is configured, the LLM will use it to get real-time data
Assistant: I'll check the current weather for you.
[assistant-function: getWeather {"location": "New York"} => {"temperature": 72, "condition": "Partly Cloudy", "humidity": 65}]
The current weather in New York is 72Â°F and partly cloudy with 65% humidity.
```

## Creating Your Own MCP Servers

You can create custom MCP servers using the `ModelContextProtocol` package. See the [official documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk) for details.

Basic steps:
1. Create a new .NET project
2. Add the `ModelContextProtocol` package
3. Define tool classes with the `[McpServerToolType]` attribute
4. Define tool methods with the `[McpServerTool]` attribute
5. Configure the server to use stdio or SSE transport
6. Build and run your server
7. Add it to ChatX using `chatx mcp add`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with MCP servers:

- Use `chatx mcp get <server-name>` to check the server configuration
- Verify that the server executable exists and is accessible
- Check that any required environment variables or arguments are correctly set
- Try running the MCP server manually to see if it starts correctly
- Enable verbose output with `chatx --verbose` to see more details about MCP connections
