# Step 1: Add Required NuGet Packages

## Plan
I'll add the following NuGet packages to the project:
- Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions
- Microsoft.Extensions.AI
- Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI

These packages will provide the necessary interfaces and implementations for working with IChatClient.

## Implementation

Added the following packages with the `--prerelease` flag (as they are currently in preview):
- Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions (9.3.0-preview.1.25161.3)
- Microsoft.Extensions.AI (9.3.0-preview.1.25161.3)
- Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI (9.3.0-preview.1.25161.3)

âœ… Packages have been successfully added to the project.
