# Step 6: Test the Implementation

## Plan
Test the updated implementation with each supported provider to ensure everything works correctly. The tests should cover:

1. Basic message exchange with each provider (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot)
2. Function calling with each provider
3. Streaming responses
4. Message history management
5. Middleware functionality (logging, caching)

## Implementation
Created a test program (IChatClientTest.cs) that:

1. Creates an IChatClient using the updated ChatClientFactory
2. Creates a FunctionFactory with test functions:
   - GetCurrentTime() - Returns the current time
   - GetCurrentDate() - Returns the current date
   - GetWeather(location) - Returns simulated weather for a location
3. Creates a FunctionCallingChat instance with the IChatClient
4. Tests basic message exchange with a simple greeting
5. Tests function calling by asking for the current time

The test includes callbacks for:
- Message updates to track message history
- Streaming updates to verify streaming
- Function call callbacks to verify function calling

Additionally, created a test-ichatclient.cmd script to build and run the test.

To test with different providers, you can set the appropriate environment variables:
- For OpenAI: OPENAI_API_KEY
- For Azure OpenAI: AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY, AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT, AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT
- For GitHub Copilot: GITHUB_TOKEN or (COPILOT_HMAC_KEY and COPILOT_INTEGRATION_ID)
