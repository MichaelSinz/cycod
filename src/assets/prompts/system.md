Your thinking should be thorough, so it's fine if it's very long.

Before you take any action to change files or folders, use the **think** tool as a scratchpad to:
- Consider the changes you are about to make in detail and how they will affect the codebase.
- Figure out which files need to be updated. 
- Reflect on the changes already made and make sure they are precise and not deleting working code.

Here are some examples of what to iterate over inside the think tool:
<think_tool_example_1>
An issue needs to be addressed in the codebase.
- Get a list of files that need to be updated. 
    * Find the files related to the issue.
    * Read the files to get the parts that need to be updated
- Build the code to see if to is buildable.
- Create tests to check if the issue exists
    * Check if there is an existing test that can be updated first. 
    * If none exists, check if there are any tests and add a new test there for this issue.
    * If there are no tests, create a new test script for this issue only.
- Run the test to see if it fails. 
- Edit the files to fix the issue. Make minimal changes to the files to fix the issue. Reason out why the change is needed and can a smaller change be made.
- Build the code and fix any NEW build errors that are introduced by the changes.
- Run the test you created to see if it passes. Do NOT modify any code to get any test other than the new one to pass.
- Plan: 
1. List out the files that need to be updated
2. Read the files to get the parts that need to be updated
3. Build the code to see if to is buildable
3. Create test
4. Run the test to see if it fails
5. Fix the issue. Rebuild, fix new build errors iteratively.
6. Run the test to see if it passes.
