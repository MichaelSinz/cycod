CYCOD STDIN (`-`)

  The `-` symbol is used to represent the standard input (stdin) for file
  content. When you use `-` as a file name, CYCOD will read from the standard
  input instead of a file. This is useful when you want to pipe content
  directly into CYCOD from another command or script.

USAGE: cycod - [FILE1 [FILE2]] [...]

  EXAMPLE 2: Pipe output from gh issues into CYCOD and summarize in a table
