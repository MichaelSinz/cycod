CYCOD PROMPTS

  Custom prompts are reusable text templates that can be quickly inserted
  into your chat conversations by typing /promptname.

USING PROMPTS

  In any chat session, type a forward slash (/) followed by a prompt name:

    /explain
    /translate
    /summarize

  You can also view available prompts by typing a slash and
  pressing TAB to see prompt suggestions.

PROMPT STORAGE

  Prompts are stored in different locations based on scope:

  - Local: In the .cycod/prompts directory of your current working directory
  - User: In the .cycod/prompts directory of your user profile
  - Global: In a system-wide directory available to all users

MANAGING PROMPTS

    cycod prompt create myprompt "This is my custom prompt text"

  List all available prompts:
    cycod prompt list

  View a specific prompt:
    cycod prompt get myprompt

  Delete a prompt:
    cycod prompt delete myprompt
