CYCODMD STDIN (`-`)

  The `-` symbol is used to represent the standard input (stdin) for file
  content. When you use `-` as a file name, CYCODMD will read from the standard
  input instead of a file. This is useful when you want to pipe content
  directly into CYCODMD from another command or script.

USAGE: cycodmd - [FILE1 [FILE2]] [...]

EXAMPLES

  EXAMPLE 1: Pipe output from git diff into CYCODMD and summarize

    git diff | cycodmd - --instructions "summarize the changes"

  EXAMPLE 2: Pipe output from gh issues into CYCODMD and summarize in a table

    gh issue list | cycodmd - --instructions "summarize in table"
