CYCODT STDIN (`-`)

  The `-` symbol is used to represent the standard input (stdin) for file
  content. When you use `-` as a file name, CYCODT will read from stdin
  instead of a named file. You can also use `@-` to read individual lines as if
  they were passed as command line arguments. These features are useful when
  you want to pipe command output into CYCODT as command line argument(s).

USAGE: cycodt [...] -
