CYCODT EXPECT

  The cycodt expect commands provide tools for working with test expectations.
  Use 'expect format' to prepare regex patterns, and 'expect check' to 
  validate output against expectations directly from the command line.

USAGE: cycodt expect format [options]
   OR: cycodt expect check [options]

EXAMPLES

  EXAMPLE 1: Format command output as regex patterns

    my-command | cycodt expect format > patterns.txt

  EXAMPLE 2: Check if command output meets expectations

    my-command | cycodt expect check --regex "^Expected output\r?$"

  EXAMPLE 3: Check output using LLM instructions

    my-command | cycodt expect check --instructions "Output should include three bullet points"
